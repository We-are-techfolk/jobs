# ClusterHQ needs you to help define and build open source containerisation software.

ClusterHQ needs you to help define and build open source containerisation software.

Containers will impact infrastructure, application architecture and software delivery as fundamentally in the coming years as virtualisation has in the last decade. Right now, the core technology and practices are being built to enable containers to move from developer tools to production-ready infrastructure for large critical systems. 

ClusterHQ is front and centre in the container world, extending containers from managing stateless applications to include filesystems, databases, queues, etc. This means application+data can be moved as a unit between hosts, enabling continuous delivery, failover and scaling.

We code in Python and Go, using asynchronous frameworks and we’ll support your transition from another language.

We’re offering relocation to Bristol UK, which is fast becoming the cloud computing hub of Europe and renowned for its high quality of life.
